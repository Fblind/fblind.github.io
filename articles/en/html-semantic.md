This post exists because in the last weeks I've been teaching the basics of HTML and I realize that *when you're teaching or you're trying to explain something to others you learn more*. Also *seeing people trying to get into the world of web development* and that I can help in that process is something that makes me really happy 😄.

The first thing I did when I started teaching my friends was *go over the basics and see ways of teaching it*, I saw some videos and read over the internet (thanks mozilla and frontendmasters 🎉👏👏). HTML itself is not a complex language, so I focused on trying to teach the most important part for me: the **semantics** of the elements.

> ### HTML is about **structure and describe our content** in the best possible way.

## What does it mean when I say *semantics* ?

Semantics means **knows the meaning of each HTML element** (if you have for example a `div` or a `span` these are generic containers without any special meaning nor semantics) and understand what we want to communicate and how is the best way to do it.

One important thing when we are creating our documents is to think several times which is the best element to describe what we want to show. Today, thanks to HTML5, we have a lot of *new semantics elements* that we can take benefit of.

With the rise of HTML5 we got several new elements that help us to describe better our content, elements like `header`, `footer`, `main`, describe our layout and are well use today. But we can go further, don't always use `div`, instead use `section` or `article`, don't always use `img` instead use `figure` and `picture`, use `strong` and `em` instead of `b` or `i`...

All of this not only help us to get the most of our HTML and really understand while we're creating it but also search engines can find us and accessibility tools can let a better experience, so when I'll be creating a component **I'll be ask myself twice what do I want to describe, communicate and which is the best element to it**
