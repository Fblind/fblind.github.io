There was a long time since I wrote something on my personal page and I've been thinking a lot about why, and I think is because I fell into the same mistake a lot of us make when the time to write on the web come: *not having consistency and get discouraged because of the lack of feedback* but for me my biggest error is thinking a lot of what should I write, I always felt that I needed to ***create* something new and amazing o super technical**. I did not only made that mistake here but also in some of the other places where I started to be active like twitter and dev.to.

With all that I've been saying, from now on my way of doing things will be different, based on what [Joel Hooks wrote](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) I also **want my blog to be a digital garden** which I'll make it grow and I'll take care of it. My idea is that this garden will be an active knowledge base, where I'll be [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), testing, teaching and also I want that this digital garden to be a place where I can find everything related to my interests and I hope this can be helpful for others too.

BTW I'm not an English native speaker and this is my first post in English without any supervision. I'm already learning in public ðŸ˜€.
