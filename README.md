# Facundo Soria Guerrero

This repo contains my personal website and blog.

The project is build with nuxt and it's generated before the deploy so I'm getting all the benefits of the JAMStack architecture. Also the blog posts are loaded from markdown files.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
