## What I think about code comments
  *"You explain why you're doing something unexpected in the comments so people coming after can understand the decisions that were made which resulted in the unexpected or odd code"
  * Don't explain trivial things, like saving the user when you function is called saveUser.
  * Don't use code comment as functions
